# **Modeling for Predictive Analysis with Premier League Data in R** {.tabset .smaller-header}

## Description
In this project, I wanted to create a model that could predict the outcome of Premier League games more accurately than the betting odds. I defined success by whether my algorithm could predict the correct outcome for the home team (win/loss/draw) more often than the outcome with the best odds of happening occurred. The first part of this project involved a tremendous amount of data cleaning. Since I already had the data for the entire 2019-20 season (up until it was suspended for COVID-19), I needed to find a way to ensure that future results were not accounted for when trying to predict a certain match. I wanted the model to behave this way so it could be used in the present to predict matches that haven't taken place yet and accurately predict matches using data that is available at the current moment. To accomplish this, I created several cumulative variables for the stats that proved to be most effective at determining match outcome in my exploratory analysis. This included things such as xG for and against, actual goals for and against, and several other variables included in the data set. Ultimately, I ended up using the mean cumulative value of each of these variables. Once the data was clean and usable, I began to test different combinations of these variables as factors in an ordinal regression model. The ordinal regression model was meant to assign each home team a probability that they won and then assign the outcome prediction based off that chance. While undergoing this process however, there was an issue with the model which led it to never pick a match to result in a draw. Given that there were many draws in the true outcomes of the matches, this greatly impacted the accuracy of the model, and I was forced to come up with a solution. What I did was find a formula that allowed me to manually create the probability intervals that represented each outcome. After doing so, and then assessing the accuracy again, I found that the model predicted more match outcomes correctly than the most favored outcome according to the betting odds.

# **MLS Player Shot Tracking with GPS** {.tabset}

## Description
This project, also in R, tasked me with finding out how many shots a certain player took during an MLS match, given only the GPS tracking data for all 22 players on the pitch and the ball. The data was split into rows for each "frame", which is just an instance of recording all the positions. This happened every 0.04 seconds throughout the match. To accomplish my task, first I modified the data to make each row of the table I was given display the ball's position at a certain time and the chosen player's position at that same time. I then sorted the data by half to account for the player attacking a different goal in the 2nd half. After that, I found every instance in which the ball was within 1 yard of the player in both the X and Y directions concurrently, to find what I thought was every time that player was in possession of the ball. Next I filtered it down to all the instances in which the ball was within this radius in one frame, and out of it the next frame, to find each time the player passed/shot/etc the ball. I then found each instance within these cases in which, after leaving the player's foot, the ball moved closer to the goal. At this point, I had narrowed down my search to 14 different cases, so I plotted each of the remaining sequences, and then examined them to determine which ones saw the ball directed at the goal. I was ultimately able to find 4 instances of what I thought were shots, with 3 of them being saved by the goalkeeper, and one of them being blocked by a defender.

# **Cricket Error Analysis in Python** {.tabset}

## Description
This project, which was completed in Python, tasked me with helping the coach of a hypothetical cricket team to identify where errors come from. In cricket, there are two common errors, known as "wides" and "no balls". The coach of the hypothetical team wanted me to find if errors seemed to stem from certain teams of if they were random in nature. After that, I had to determine if maximizing error margin was a valid strategy for improving performance, and then identify any ways of making this possible. The point of all this was to determine if the coach should spend more time with the team practicing to reduce errors, or instead find ways to try to force more errors. I ended up investigating certain teams' error habits while controlling for their opponent to see if specific teams seems to cause more errors than expected. More information on my appraoch is indcluded in the presentation tab.
